"I'm here looking for writers who are interested in collective poetry practices. I've been writing and teaching writing for about 25 years. One thing that I enjoy is sharing and swapping writing projects. I'm in Chicago, which is +7 GMT. I hope to spend a few hours each week working on writing projects and meeting other members. I would spend Sunday afternoons participating in the tribe. I would like to know what kind of writing other members are doing. Right now, I'm dividing my time between experimental poetry and weird fiction. ",        tribalSignPath:

"I've been making music for thirty years. I teach guitar, piano, drums and voice. I have worked with many professional musicians and recorded several albums. Classical metal is my jam, but I listen to everything that's worth a damn. I'm looking to swap stories with other musicians and give advice to the new beginners. I live in the U.S.A. in the Pacific northwest. My time zone is GMT -8. I plan to check in whenever I can - mostly when I'm at work :)  Playing guitar is what gives me joy. I guess I just want to know what everyone is listening to. ",        tribalSignPath:

"Hi! We are a couple from Germany. We have both been retired for three years now--and we have spent as much of that time traveling as we can. We are attempting to visit each continent (except Antarctica!) in our caravan, and looking for other travelers who are doing the same. Who knows--we might even be able to meet on the road. For the next six months, we are visiting Australia. Our location will change every week.  We started in Perth and spent a week near Bremer Bay. Next we plan to travel along the coast to Cape Le Grand, then head north to Dundas Reserve. We'll check in as often as we can. We would like to know your travel plans, especially if you are currently down under.",        tribalSignPath:
